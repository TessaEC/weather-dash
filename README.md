Bootcamp Challenge #6 - Dashboard to retrieve weather data using Open Weather API.

## Description
The user will happen upon a friendly and playful interface where they will be able to perform a search for their desired city. Once the user has searched for their city, they will see current and a future 5-day weather forecast.

## Usage
This weather dashboard uses Open Weather's API to grab the selected weather information and display it onto formatted cards. Once the user clicks the "Rain or Shine?" button to submit their search input, the weather will be displayed. They will be able to see the temperature, humidity and wind speed for that city. On top of being able to search for a city, all input is saved and displayed under search history as a button for the user to refer back to at a later time.

## Visuals:

### Javascript Functionality
Javascript has a combination of creating buttons, using an ajax call to retrieve Open Weather's information using an API, and template literals inserted into HTML cards to retrieve specific information to be displayed onto the formatted cards.
